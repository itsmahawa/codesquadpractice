    <h3><i>What else is there about Meat?</i></h3>
    <p>
      Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times.
      The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as
      chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle. This eventually led to their
      use in meat production on an industrial scale with the aid of
      slaughterhouses.
